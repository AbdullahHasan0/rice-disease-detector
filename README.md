# 🌾 Rice Disease Detector

A deep learning-powered web app to detect **rice crop diseases** from leaf images using **ResNet18** and **Streamlit**.  

> 🚜 Helping farmers make quicker decisions with AI-powered plant diagnostics.

---

## 📌 Project Motivation

Rice is a staple food for more than half the world’s population. Diseases like **Bacterial Blight**, **Blast**, and **False Smut** can severely reduce yield if not detected early.  
This app aims to:
- Identify rice diseases from leaf images
- Suggest possible mitigation measures
- Provide a low-cost, AI-based alternative to expert consultation

## 🧠 Dataset

- 📂 **Source**: [Kaggle – Rice Crop Diseases](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thegoanpanda/rice-crop-diseases)
- 🔢 **Total Classes**:
  - Bacterial Blight Disease
  - Blast Disease
  - Brown Spot Disease
  - False Smut Disease
- 🖼️ ~50 high-resolution leaf images per class

## 🖼️ Preprocessing Strategy

Images are resized and normalized to match ResNet18’s expected input.  
**Steps:**
- Convert BGR → RGB (OpenCV)
- Resize to **224×224**
- Apply `torchvision.transforms`:
  - Random horizontal/vertical flip
  - Random rotation and color jitter (train set)
  - Normalization (ImageNet mean & std)

---

## 🧠 Model: ResNet18

- Used `resnet18(pretrained=True)` from `torchvision.models`
- Final fully connected layer modified to `nn.Linear(in_features=512, out_features=4)`
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Scheduler: StepLR
